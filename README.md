# cppScriptureSort
This repository is a scripture sorting algorithm in C++.

Users are prompted in the terminal to enter the book of the Bible they want to analyze.
They are then asked for the specific words they want to find verses for, or the count of that specific word in the book.

The result is given in the command terminal, but it can also be exported to external text files with a terminal function such as the '>' operator.
